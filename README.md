# Visualizing the three body problem
This projects uses the universal law of gravitation, some simple ordinary differential equations and the [VPython](https://vpython.org/) library to visualize a simulation of the [three body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem). Run the simulation yourself with: `$ python3 src/main.py`

## To do
* Collision detection.
* Implement my own ODE solver to ensure energy conservation.
* Make it scalable for $n$ bodies.
